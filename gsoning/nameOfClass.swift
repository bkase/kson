/**
    Returns the name of a class as a string.

    This method is a counterpart for Objective-C's `NSStringFromClass()` written in swift and compatible with every class in swift.
    Make sure not to call this method with a struct or any other type apart from a class, i.e. calling this method with `String` will result in an error.
    
        let className = nameOfClass(MyClass)
        let myObject = MyClass()
        let objectClassName = nameOfClass(myObject.dynamicType)

    Due to namespaces in swift the macro NSStringFromClass() does not return the simple class name, but a name including the module name.
    Swift's classes begin typically with "_TtC", followed by the number of how many characters the module name has which follows as the string followed again by a number which describes the number of characters of the class name which follows.
    As an example if MyClass in the app named MyProject is given then the class name will be "_TtC9MyProject7MyClass".
    This method uses NSStringFromClass(), parses the returned string and returns only the name of the class without any prefixes, numbers and module names.
    
    However, a swift class may also be marked with @objc and a custom name in parenthesis to name the class without a module name.
    So if MyClass has a leading @objc(MyObjCClass) this will result in the classes' name to be "MyObjCClass" instead of "MyClass".
    In this case the name already has the valid form and is returned without further string processing.

    @param classType: A class type.
    @return The classes' name as a String.
